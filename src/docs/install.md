# Install

`<qa-bot>` is distributed on npm, so you can install it locally or use it via npm CDNs like jsdelivr.

## Local Installation

```bash
npm i qabot
```

## CDN

npm CDNs like [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) can directly serve files that have been published to npm. This works great for standard JavaScript modules that the browser can load natively.

### HTML

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qabot"></script>
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import QABot from 'qabot';
```
